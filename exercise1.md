Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked? You can search for the answers by google.

The language I've picked is Java. Some tools for linting are: Checkstyle, SonarLint, SonarQube, Spotless. Some tools for testing are: Selenium, JUnit, Serenity, TestNG. Some tools for building are: Ant, Maven, Gradle.

What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? Again, you can ask google!

Some alternatives are: GitLab, CircleCI, CloudBees, Ansible. 

Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

This setup would probably be better in a cloud-based environment, only because this a small project being done by a team of only six. It would be the simplest method. Team and project size as well as special configuration requirements are details that are needed to make that decision. A larger team and project and a more complicated setup may benefit from a self-hosted environment.
